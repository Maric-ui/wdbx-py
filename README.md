## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with WDBX-Py, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Maric-ui/wdbx-py.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd wdbx-py
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   python main.py
   ```

## Usage üìö

Using WDBX is straightforward. Here‚Äôs a simple example to help you get started:

```python
from wdbx import WDBX

# Initialize the database
db = WDBX()

# Add data
db.add_vector("example_vector", [0.1, 0.2, 0.3])

# Query data
result = db.query_vector([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])
print(result)
```

This snippet demonstrates how to initialize the database, add a vector, and query it. For more complex queries and operations, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/Maric-ui/wdbx-py/wiki).

## Plugins üîå

WDBX supports a variety of plugins to extend its functionality. Here‚Äôs how to create and use a plugin:

1. Create a new plugin file in the `plugins` directory.
2. Define your plugin class, implementing the required methods.
3. Load your plugin in the main application.

Example plugin structure:

```python
class MyPlugin:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization code here

    def run(self):
        # Plugin functionality here
```
